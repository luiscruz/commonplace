## What is Commonplace?

**TL;DR:** A server for your markdown files. Give it a directory, and Commonplace gives you a url, pretty pages, and quick editing.

I write quite a bit of Markdown, and usually keep my `.md` files scattered around my hard-drive. Commonplace is a simple sinatra-based server to browse and quickly edit your markdown files. It works by reading `.md` files from a directory you configure (my advice would be to keep this directory backed up through [Dropbox](http://getdropbox.com)). The name draws inspiration from [commonplace books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book).

Commonplace is not meant to be a markdown editor, even though it includes basic editing capabilities. There are a number of tools that do editing extremely well - I happen to use [Byword](http://bywordapp.com) for Mac but you get to choose your own poison. If you edit the markdown files in an external editor, changes are reflected in commonplace after refreshes.

### Installing Commonplace

Installing Commonplace is actually really easy - all you need is ruby (which if you're on a fairly recent mac, you already have).

* Clone Commonplace to your local machine `git clone git://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace.git`
* Install bundler, if you haven't got it yet `gem install bundler`
* Using bundler, install Commonplace's dependencies with `bundle install`
* Create `config/commonplace.yml`, based on the `commonplace.yml.example` file
* You're ready to start using Commonplace

### Running Commonplace

Once you're installed, running Commonplace is trivial.

* Head over to the directory where you installed commonplace, if you're not there already
* Run `shotgun` and open `http://localhost:9393` in your browser
* You're done, get cranking!

### Running on JRuby
Since shotgun doesn't run on jruby, we use Sinatra Reloading:

* Head over to the directory where you installed commonplace, if you're not there already
* `rackup config.ru` to run commonplace
* Open `http://localhost:9292` in your browser
* You're done, get cranking!

### Running on Windows

Since shotgun doesn't run on windows, you need to install Thin instead. Here's what you do:

* `gem install thin` to install thin in your system
* `thin -R config.ru start` to run commonplace

## Things for the advanced nerds

### Syncing with Dropbox

You can edit the directory where Commonplace serves files from by editing the `config/commonplace.yml` file and restarting your server. For extra spice, use a directory somewhere inside your [Dropbox](http://getdropbox.com) folder to have constant syncing across your computers and automatic backups to the cloud. Delicious. As long as this directory has a `home.md` file inside which is used as the main entry point for Commonplace, you're all set.

### Hosting with Apache

If you have an Apache server, you can use passenger to serve Commonplace. While installing passenger is out of scope of this document, instructions [are available here](http://www.modrails.com/install.html). Once this is done, a VirtualHost entry like the one below should be all you need:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName commonplace.yourdomain.com
        DocumentRoot /Users/fred/Projects/personal/commonplace/public
    	RackEnv development
        <Directory /Users/fred/Projects/personal/commonplace>
            Allow from all
            Options -MultiViews
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

### Hosting with Nginx

If you have a server running Nginx with passenger, here's what you need to add to your `nginx.conf` (or whatever configuration file you use):

	server {
		listen 80;
		server_name commonplace.yourdomain.com;
		root /home/commonplace/commonplace/public;
		passenger_enabled on;
	}

### Running the specs

There's a number of specs to test out the Commonplace functionality available on the `spec` directory. In order to run these tests, use the `rake` utility in the commonplace root folder. Green is good, red is bad. You shouldn't see any red.
